## Description

This is a full-stack application that demonstrates api routes that are deployed to a server (insomnia in this case). The video demonstrates the ability to complete Get, Put, Post, and Delete requests within the scope of insomnia, while simultaneously updated the database on mysql. Codebase includes schema and seed commands to establish basis of database. The server is started and the models for the MySQL database are synced. In this project, the Sequelize wrapper is used to have a more DRY code.
<p>MySQL password, database name, and username are added to an environment variable for protection.</p>
